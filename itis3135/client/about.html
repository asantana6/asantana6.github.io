        <h2>About Me</h2>  
        <p>I am a student at East Carolina University and am currently in my second year, 
            working towards a Bachelor of Fine Arts with a concentration in Acting and a 
            minor in Creative Writing. I have been passionate about theater since middle school, 
            and it has been my world ever since. Recently, I have discovered my love for Shakespeare 
            (especially Macbeth) and have joined the club “The Shakespeare Guild” to participate in their 
            productions.</p>
