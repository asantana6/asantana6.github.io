        <h3>Checklist for Jonathan Jagdon</h3>
        <ul>    
            <li>✔ Submission leads to right page.</li>
            <li>✔ No spaces/uppercase in file/folder names.</li>
            <li>✔ Easy to read and has good contrast.</li>
            <li>✔ Pages have header, footer, and main. Alongside that there is a working navbar.</li>
            <li>Site is incomplete, and has images that are missing.</li>
        <li>Contains information that does not pertain to the site.</li>
        <li>Not sure what the site's purpose is. It's about skating but 
            there isnt much of a purpose to it. Is the site a perfonal blog? If so you might want to say that.</li>
        </ul>
