                <h3>Good Design</h3>
                <a href="https://www.icebergdoc.org/" target="_blank">IcebergDoc</a>
                <p>The website is for a documentary about climate change. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The site has good contrast, it has white text over darker backgrounds, allowing for ease of readability.</li>
                    <li>Repitition: The site only repeat certain ideas and images. Like it contains several pencil scratches throughout the page
                        , and pictures of icebergs.
                    </li>
                    <li>Alignment: The navbar is always at the top. The text changes whether its aligned left or centered, but it does so in ways that make sense
                        and look appealing.
                    </li>
                    <li>Proximity: The site is well organized, as I scroll down it does get a bit confusing once the scrolling moves things left and right instead
                         of up and down.</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Overall, I think the website, while being a bit confusing at first, is well designed and easy to read. There are lots of flowing graphics and smooth
                    animations that make it a fun experience to look at.
                </p>

                <h2>Bad Design</h2>
                <a href="https://arngren.net/" target="_blank">Arngren</a>
                <p>The website is a norwegian website made to sell automobiles and other objects. It is hard to tell
                    what exactly it does because of how cluttered and full the website is. It is also hard to navigate
                    because of how many links and broken links there are.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Contrast: The site has a lot of contrast, so it is hard to read. Thereare a lot of images on the site, and
                        each link is a different font size and color.
                    </li>
                    <li>Repition: There is no repition in the site, but everything is all over the place. Links and designs are plastered everywhere,
                        and if you try using google translate to translate it to english, all the text overflows and stacks up on each other, making
                        it unreadable.
                    </li>
                    <li>Alignment: The only alignment on the site is the navbar on the left of the site. But that is purely because
                        each link is below the other. Nothing else on the site is aligned to anything.
                    </li>
                    <li>Proximity: There is no proximity between everything. Each image is incredibly close to each other, and the links and text tend
                        to be right next to each other too.
                    </li>
                </ul>

                <p>Overall this site not just fails at CRAP, but it fails at everything a website should be. It does not work properly and it is so hard to read
                    the text that there is no point in even attempting to.
                </p>
