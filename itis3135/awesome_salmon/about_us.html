        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>When I was a child, the first fish I ever caught was a Salmon. Since then I have had a deep and loving 
            relationship with salmon. I became a chef to prepare and cook my favorite fish for my family and friends. 
            They told me to pursue this as a career and to start my own business.</p>
