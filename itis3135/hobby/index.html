        <section> <h3>Who</h3>
            <p>
                I am Abdiel. Im a Puertorican who has been making music for around four years. I play guitar and am learning
                how to play piano and keys. In the future I want to learn how to play drums, bass guitar, and organ. Im a music
                nerd who reads up a lot on information on bands and music I like. 
            </p>

            <p>
                In my free time, I also draw. I like illustrating and designing characters. I've been drawing nearly all my life,
                but only really started taking it seriously around six years ago. Alongside drawing, I also like to
                sing. I was a part of a choir group during my senior year of high school, and I was a bass 2. This meant I was singing
                the lowest notes in the ensemble. I also learned most of my music theory in that class which I still use to this day.

        <section>What

            

            
            <p>My hobby is making music. It's a bit of an ambiguous thing to say but that's because 
            I am oftentimes doing very different things with my music. For example, I like to make
            rock music, jazz music, and videogame music. I dabble with classical music, and ambient/expeimental
            music. I love Prog Rock, Punk Rock, and Surf Rock. These genres hugely influence the music I make.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my biggest musical influences are:
            <ul>
                <li>Emerson, Lake, and Palmer (ELP)</li>
                <li>Pink Floyd</li>
                <li>Primus</li>
                <li>Nobuo Uematsu</li>
                <li>Swans</li>
                <li>King Crimson</li>
                <li>The Smiths</li>
                <li>Dead Kennedys</li>
                <li>Toby Fox</li>
                <li>Zun</li>

            </ul>

        <section>When
            <p>I tend to make music whenever I have free time. Whether it is in the morning before class or late at night after finishing
                my homework. I ocassionally meet with friends and make music with them, jamming together with guitar.
            </p>

            <p>
                Usually I also make music whenever I learn some new music theory either through class, watching a video online, or listening
                to a song and being inspired by it. This tends to make some of the best music I make. One of my most recent pieces was
                made right after class and it was inspired by an Uematsu piece that I was listening to. Wrote the entire song in one sitting
                from 4pm to 8pm. It was an orchestral arrangement experimenting with mixed meter and a brass ensemble. Here it is below:

        <section>Where
            <p> I make my music in my dorm room. Somtimes in my room at my parent's house. I've also met with some friends 
                to play guitar in the dorm halls and in their apartments.

        <section>How
                <p>Depending on what music I am making, I might use a computer or a guitar. Usually I use a computer, but sometimes I have 
                    written some music or riffs on either guitar or piano. I have a mini keyboard I can plug into my computer, and a full
                    88 key piano back at home that I use and practice. I can also plug my guitar into my computer to record and practice.
                </p>

                <p>The program I use when making music is FL Studio. Ive been using it for years, however only more recently have I been
                    using it more often, since I found out how to use soundfonts. Soundfonts are a collection of instruments in the sf2 file
                    format that is used to make sound in FL Studio. I have a collection of soundfonts that I use when I make music, mainly from
                    old school videogames. My favorite soundfonts are the Touhou soundfonts, the Final Fantasy 7 soundfonts, and the PC-98
                    soundfont. These contain a wide variety of both live sounding instruments, and old sounding instruments.  </p>
                    
                <p>
                    I play with a Seafoam Green Squier Stratocaster. Ive been wanting to upgrade my guitar, but this one gets the job done. It
                    has a nice tone that I like, and the colors are awesome. I play on bridge pickups, and tend to pick as close as I can to the 
                    bridge to give the guitar a twangy and sphagetti tone that is heard in surf guitar and in jangle guitar. 
                    When it comes to guitar effects I have two sounds I like. One is a jangley sound, and the other is distorted. For my jangley sound
                    I use chorus with both rate and width at around 1oClock, and I use spring reverb with knob at 12oClock. My distorted sound
                    has bass and mids at 2oClock, and treble at 1oClock. This is because I do not like when distorted guitar has too much treble
                    and too little bass. It's one of my issues with a lot of metal music as that is the guitar tone in most metal music. Punk has 
                    amazing tones as its usually very punchy and has a good amount of bass and mids. I usually put the distortion knob low (8oClock)since I don't 
                    like it being too loud nor too distorted. Here is my jangley tone:

        <section>Why
            <p>I make music because I love it. I've been listening to music for years now and its been a huge part of my life
                since I started. I think music is very lovely as it is a sort of universal language. You can listen to music from all around 
                the world and enjoy it.
