        <section>What
            <p>My hobby is making music. It's a bit of an ambiguous thing to say but that's because 
            I am oftentimes doing very different things with my music. For example, I like to make
            rock music, jazz music, and videogame music. I dabble with classical music, and ambient/expeimental
            music. I love Prog Rock, Punk Rock, and Surf Rock. These genres hugely influence the music I make.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of my biggest musical influences are:
            <ul>
                <li>Emerson, Lake, and Palmer (ELP)</li>
                <li>Pink Floyd</li>
                <li>Primus</li>
                <li>Nobuo Uematsu</li>
                <li>Swans</li>
                <li>King Crimson</li>
                <li>The Smiths</li>
                <li>Dead Kennedys</li>
                <li>Toby Fox</li>
                <li>Zun</li>

            </ul>

        <section>When
            <p>I tend to make music whenever I have free time. Whether it is in the morning before class or late at night after finishing
                my homework. I ocassionally meet with friends and make music with them, jamming together with guitar.
            </p>

            <p>
                Usually I also make music whenever I learn some new music theory either through class, watching a video online, or listening
                to a song and being inspired by it. This tends to make some of the best music I make. One of my most recent pieces was
                made right after class and it was inspired by an Uematsu piece that I was listening to. Wrote the entire song in one sitting
                from 4pm to 8pm. It was an orchestral arrangement experimenting with mixed meter and a brass ensemble.
            </p>

        </section>
        <section>Where
            <p> I make my music in my dorm room. Somtimes in my room at my parent's house. I've also met with some friends 
                to play guitar in the dorm halls and in their apartments.
